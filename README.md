# 🎙️ Introducing Python Voice Assistant! 🐍


Using Python libraries like speech recognition and text-to-speech, I've created a voice assistant that can perform various tasks:

🕒 Time and Date: Ask it for the current time, day, month, or year.
🌦️ Weather: Get real-time weather updates for your location.
🎵 Music: Play your favorite songs with just a voice command.
🌐 Web Search: Open Google or YouTube directly from the assistant.
💡 Personal Info: Learn about the assistant's name, creator, and more.

It's a fun way to explore voice recognition and automation in Python! 🐍💬
